Vanitas is a modern transparent UI resourcepack for Minecraft Java Edition.

Vanitas is currently under development and thus will experience further changes that exceed those made necessary by new Minecraft Java Edition releases. Please report any issues using the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/iJustLeyxo/Vanitas/issues/new).

Vanitas is currently only available for the following Minecraft Java Edition Versions:
(LTS = long term support)
- 1.21 (newest release) LTS
- 1.20 ~ 1.20.6 (2nd newest release and all subreleases) LTS
- 1.11 ~ 1.12.2 LTS
- 1.6.1 ~ 1.8.9 LTS
Vanitas will always be upated for the newest two Minecraft Java Edition releases and all subreleases, aswell as specific long term supported versions as soon as possible. Other version compatibility might be added upon request and when deemed beneficial to the project.

Vanitas currently does not offer any compatibility with any mods. Mod compatibility is planned for future releases.

This resourcepack replaces the vanilla GUI textures and replaces them with minimal and transparent new textures in a modern design. This includes:
- Menu and settings textures (buttons, sliders, text input fields, selection arrows, etc.)
- Container textures (interactive blocks & inventories)
- Advancements textures
- Hotbar, health-bar, hunger-bar, xp-bar, jump-bar and boss-bar textures
- Toasts textures (advancements, recipe, tutorial and system message popups)
- Item slot textures
- Heart particle textures
